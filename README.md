# IceBucket - Folder Synchronization Tool

**IceBucket** is a simple background service that synchronizes local folders with AWS S3.  
Currently, only **uploading to S3** is implemented, but download and bi-directional sync will be added soon.

## üöÄ Features
- Runs as a **Windows tray application** with a minimal UI.
- **Uploads files to AWS S3** automatically.
- Supports **custom sync intervals** and multiple directories.
- Lightweight, with **no unnecessary dependencies**.

## Plan

- Synchronize files with any external service, including S3, Azure, and even just an FTP server.
- Provide an interface to define which folders to synchronize.
- Provide an interface showing the most recent actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Config File (`settings.json`)**
By default, the app creates a `settings.json` file in the same directory if it doesn't exist.

```json
{
  "service": "s3",
  "access_key": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
  "secret_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "bucket": "your-bucket-name",
  "sync_type": "upload-only",
  "conflicts": "keep-local",
  "directories_to_scan": ["C:/Users/Me/Documents", "D:/Backup"],
  "seconds_between_scans": 60
}
```

### **Configuration Options**
| Key                 | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
