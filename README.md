# IceBucket - Folder Synchronization Tool

**IceBucket** is a simple background service that synchronizes local folders with AWS S3.  
Currently, only **uploading to S3** is implemented, but download and bi-directional sync will be added soon.

## üöÄ Features
- Runs as a **Windows tray application** with a minimal UI.
- **Uploads files to AWS S3** automatically.
- Supports **custom sync intervals** and multiple directories.
- Lightweight, with **no unnecessary dependencies**.

## Plan

- Synchronize files with any external service, including S3, Azure, and even just an FTP server.
- Provide an interface to define which folders to synchronize.
- Provide an interface showing the most recent actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Config File (`settings.json`)**
By default, the app creates a `settings.json` file in the same directory if it doesn't exist.

```json
{
  "service": "s3",
  "access_key": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
  "secret_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "bucket": "your-bucket-name",
  "sync_type": "upload-only",
  "conflicts": "keep-local",
  "directories_to_scan": ["C:/Users/Me/Documents", "D:/Backup"],
  "seconds_between_scans": 60
}
```

### **Configuration Options**
| Key                 | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `service`          | Must be `"s3"` for AWS S3 support. |
| `access_key`       | AWS Access Key ID. |
| `secret_key`       | AWS Secret Access Key. |
| `region`          | AWS region (e.g., `"us-east-1"`). |
| `bucket`          | S3 bucket name where files are uploaded. |
| `sync_type`       | `"upload-only"`, `"download-only"`, or `"upload-and-download"`. |
| `conflicts`       | `"keep-local"` (keep local version) or `"use-remote"` (overwrite with remote). |
| `directories_to_scan` | List of local directories to sync. |
| `seconds_between_scans` | How often (in seconds) to sync changes. |

- Verify the S3 bucket exists and has correct permissions.
- Run manually to check for errors.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via pull requests. You're welcome to submit any changes you would like to make! However, think very carefully before introducing additional dependencies. A top priority of this project is that it runs simply from "cargo run" with as little additional configuration as possible. Many packages require native compiling of C and other packages, adding serious complexity to the end user.

### Todo: Wix

https://wixtoolset.org/releases/

cargo build --release --workspace

cargo wix -p icebucket-core

cargo wix -b "C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin"
